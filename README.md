### Arithmetical calculator:
The designed system should be able to perform the sequential processes given as follows by using the results obtained at the end of one process in the other process. It should detect every new variable seen on the left side of the equation and update the value of this variable according to the operation result used..

a = 3 ;
b = 2 ;
c = a + b * 4 ;
b = c + b * 2 ;
d = a * ( b â€“ c ) / 2 ;
Example values:
a-3, b-2, c-11, b-15, d-6

### Creating a new maze and finding its exit with DFS:
For a given N number and a given NxN maze, an algorithm will be designed to find out whether there is a path from the starting cell (1,1) to the ending cell (N, N) using the DFS (Depth First Search) method. DFS method applied by recursive approach.

### Sorted array to tree:
In order to do binary search easily, the code converts a sorted array to tree.
